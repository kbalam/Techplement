# Contact Management System

A simple and efficient command-line-based contact management system implemented in Python. This project allows users to add, view, edit, delete, and list contacts, ensuring data persistence through JSON file storage.

## Features

- **Add Contact**: Add a new contact with a name, phone number, and email address. The system checks for duplicate names, phone numbers, and email addresses to avoid conflicts.
- **View Contact**: Retrieve and display the details of a specific contact by name.
- **Edit Contact**: Update the name, phone number, or email address of an existing contact while ensuring no duplicates exist.
- **Delete Contact**: Remove a contact from the system by specifying the name.
- **List Contacts**: Display all the contacts in the system in a neatly formatted manner.
- **Persistent Storage**: All contact details are saved in a JSON file, ensuring data is retained even after the program is closed.
